# Programiz PRO – C++ Challenges

This repository contains my solutions for **C++ coding challenges** from [Programiz PRO – Coding Challenges](https://programiz.pro/community-challenges).  
Each challenge has its own file, and at the top of each file you will find a comment with a direct link to the problem statement.

## Structure
- Each problem is solved in a separate `.cpp` file.
- The filename usually reflects the challenge or its order.
- Problem link is added as a comment at the top of each file.
